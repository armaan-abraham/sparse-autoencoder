# Sparse Autoencoder for Interpreting LLMs

This repository contains code for training a sparse autoencoder on activations of LLMs, as in [Anthropic's Towards Monosemanticity](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html), as well as an analysis of how feature directions depend on both cooccurrence and LLM output similarity.

See [analysis.ipynb](analysis.ipynb).
